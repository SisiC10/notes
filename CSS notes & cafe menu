*You can add style to an element by specifying it in the style element and setting a property for it like this:
element {
 property: value;
}

EXAMPLE;
<style>
      h1, h2, p {
        text-align: center;
      }
    </style>

*a seperate folder is used for the style ('style.css) so its not in with the html code. <style></style> is taken out. Instead we reference style.css:
<link href="styles.css" rel="stylesheet"/>

*To make it look the same on a laptop and mobile phone:
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />

<div>: used for design layour purposes. Put after '<body>

A class selector is defined by a name with a dot directly in front of it.
